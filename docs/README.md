# Ambi-Beats
Ambi-Beats is a react native application that plays music based on the user's preference, location, and time/date. As the user goes about his/her business, certain songs will play to match the ambience that the user is currently surrounded in. I've always liked to imagine my life as a grand movie so having the right music is essential to making that imagination a reality.
